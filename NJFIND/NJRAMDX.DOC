Documentation for NJRAMDX.SYS:

NJRAMDX.SYS is based on NJRAMD.SYS, (C) 1987 By Mike Blaszczak.

NJRAMD.SYS is ShareWare, a $15 donation is requested.

For a complete specification, look at NJRAMD.DOC.



Version 1.02:  Modified to be compatible with QEMM386.SYS V5.11.
 90-10-01      QEMM does not follow the XMS spec completely, in that it
               will return values other than 0 in BL to show success.
               This version is modified to ignore any return code in BL
               when asking for the amount of XMS RAM available.

NJRAMDX.SYS is an XMS RAM disk, compatible with HIMEM.SYS from Windows 3.0. 
It is 25-40% faster than RAMDRIVE.SYS, and uses less than 600 bytes of
conventional (lower 640K) RAM.

The syntax is:

DEVICE=[path]NJRAMDX.SYS [ [size] | [/A] ] [/S]

where

size  : size of disk in KB, default = 512.

/A    : Use All free XMS memory.

/S    : Silent. By default, NJRAMDX.SYS will click the speaker on all
        i/o to/from the RAM disk. This gives an audible indication that
        the disk is beeing accessed. 

        With the sound disabled, the resident portion of the driver will
        be slightly smaller.
