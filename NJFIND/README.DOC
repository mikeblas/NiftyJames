Nifty James' Famous RAM Disk 
Version 1.40ASP Release Notes

Recently, Terje Mathisen made the necessary tweaks for NJRAMD to have
it run in extended memory.  This means that NJRAMD can now use the
memory given to your system by XMS drivers such as HIMEM.SYS and
QEMM.SYS, making NJRAMD compatible with Windows.

This version has been a long time coming.  As many of you know, I had
intended to write it myself for some time.  This version of NJRAMD
does not contain a changed EMS version, but gets a new version to
show that it is now XMS compatible.

As usual, if you have any questions about NJRAMD, please feel free to
write to me.
