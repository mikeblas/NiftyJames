     PURPOSE                         
     -------
     
     NJFIND is a file-finder utility.  Users with large (or crowded) hard
     disk drives will welcome NJFIND as a tool to find filenames based on
     a wildcard specification.  NJFIND works across all directories of a
|    logical drive, and will even open DWC, ZIP, LZH, ZOO, PAK, ARJ,
|    and ARC files to check them for matching filenames.  NJFIND can also
|    scan across different disk drives, if you so desire.
     
     
     
     FEATURES
     --------
     
     NJFIND works with standard DOS file names.  The program will also
     "open" several types of archive files.  These include the popular ZIP
     and ARC formats, as well as the public domain ZOO and LZH formats.
     NJFIND also can read PAK files.
     
     NJFIND runs quickly.  I have over two-hundred files stored with LHARC
     on my hard drive, and I have over fifteen-hundred files on my hard
     drive.  NJFIND will scan the entire drive in less than thirty
     seconds.
     
     NJFIND requires less than twenty kilobytes of disk space.  Because
     it uses standard DOS file input and output. Because it uses no
     special trickery, the program should be compatible with protected
     environments such as DesqView and Microsoft Windows.
     
     NJFIND has been tested successfully on an IBM Token Ring network using
     Novell SFT Netware.

|    NJFIND allows the user to keep a set of their favorite options in the
|    system environment so that commonly-used options need not be retyped
|    each time the program is invoked.

     
     
     
     USAGE
     -----
     
     You may use NJFIND to scan all of your hard drive and all archive
     files by using the command followed by a filename.  For example:
     
        NJFIND GOOFY.TXT
     
     searches the current drive for the file GOOFY.TXT.  Should you wish,
     you can have NJFIND run a drive other than the default drive.  To do
     this, simply include a drive specification.  To look for GOOFY.TXT on
     drive H, one would use the command
     
        NJFIND H:GOOFY.TXT
     
     If you are looking for a file with a name you can't specifically
     remember, you may use wildcards in the filename given to NJFIND to
     search the drives and files on your system.  If you knew that your
     text file began with a G, for example, you might use
     
        NJFIND H:G*.TXT
     
     If you knew that you had called the file MODEL but couldn't remember
     the extension it had,
     
        NJFIND MODEL.*
     
     would do the job.

     Note that NJFIND searches *all* archive files it notices, even
     if they don't match the wildcard specification that you supply.
     
     If you have many of the supported archive files on your diskette, you
     may be noticing that NJFIND runs a little slower.  If you are looking
     only for "normal" DOS files, you can use the /N option to cause
     NJFIND to search only DOS directories.  That would make the above
     command look like this:
     
        NJFIND /N MODEL.*
     
     Since you might know that the file is not stored in an archive, you
     can expidite the search by using /N.  Normally, NJFIND searches ZIP,
     ARC, ZOO, PAK, and LZH files when it finds them.  You can switch off
     these file choices individually, as well.  For example, to search for
     NJFIND.C without looking in LZH or ZOO files, you may use
     
        NJFIND /O /L NJFIND.C
     
     The options and their related archive files are shown here:
     
        /A              Don't search throghh ARC files
        /L              Don't search through LZH files
        /O              Don't search through ZOO files
        /P              Don't search through PAK files
        /Z              Don't search through ZIP files
	/W		Don't search through DWC files
|	/J		Don't search through ARJ files
     
|    You might notice that /N is simply a more convenient form for
|    using /A /L /O /P /Z /W /J all out.
     
     If you'd like, you can have NJFIND print out messages as it traverses
     your hard drive and checks files.  To do this, use the /D option to
     display the filenames NJFIND searches through, as well as the ones it
     finds.
     
     NJFIND is capable of displaying file directory information, as well. 
     If you would like to see the last modification date and time as well
     as the attributes and size of found files, use the /V option.  /V
     stands for "verbose mode".
     
     It is often handy to have just a total of file information.  For
     example, you might want to see how many .GIF files are on your hard
     disk, and how much room they're taking up.  You can use the /T option
     to have NJFIND print out only the totals information, instead of also
     displaying the name and location of all the found files.
     
     Our example with .GIF files might look like this:
     
        NJFIND /T *.GIF

     When NJFIND prints out the number of files found, the number
     indicates the number of files that were not in archives.  If any
     files were "inside" of archives, NJFIND will note that number of
     files with "archived files".

     If you ran NJFIND and it printed, for example,

        6 files found.
        18 archive files found.

     it would mean that NJFIND came across 24 files that matched your
     specification.  Six of these files were regular DOS files, but
     eighteen of the files were actually inside archive files.

     NJFIND will search through archive files if it finds them and
     recognizes them by their extension.  Notice that, if you have an
     archive file and it doesn't have the normal file extension, the
     file won't be checked by NJFIND.
     
     If you find yourself confused about NJFIND's options, you can run
     NJFIND without any options and it will show you a display of the
     usage information.  NJFIND will also do this if you try to use an
     option it doesn't recognize.

     If you're running NJFIND and realize something's wrong (or you
     have a huge disk and ge tired of waiting), you can use <CTRL+C> or
     <CTRL+BREAK> to stop the program.  NJFIND will tell you what
     it's found so far, and then leave you at the DOS prompt.

     Edward Mendelson wrote to me on CompuServe and suggested that I
     provide an option to allow the program to search through all the
     drives attached to a system.  This was a pretty good idea and
     I have implemented it in Release 1.10.  If you use the /R
     option, NJFIND will go through all of the drives looking for
     your file.  If the filespec you provide contains a drive
     specification, it will be ignored.  NJFIND searches your drives
     in alphabetical order, starting with your first hard disk drive
     or RAM disk, such as NJRAMD.  NJFIND does not search floppy
     drives in this mode.
 
     Both Edward and Heward Hane noticed that NJFIND occasionally
     printed out that a archive file was found in the target file;
     that is, the file found message was ocassionally reversed.  This
     problem has been fixed in Release 1.10.
 
     Edward Mendelson noticed a problem matching spurious filenames
     in this release.  The rub was that NJFIND would match files
     shorter than the wildcarded filespec, but only when the wildcard
     didn't extend into the actual filename.  (Whew!)  Again, hats
     off to Edward, who seemingly doesn't sleep when our world has
     buggy software!

|    David Nanian sent me a note on BIX mentioning that NJFIND, when
|    compiled with a different compiler than I used, generated code that
|    caused a system crash.  As it turned out, some mutant memory
|    allocation was going on in some of the code, and this got tidied up.
      
      
     LEGAL JUNK
     ----------
     
     ARC is a file format and a file compression program developed and
     sold by System Enhancement Associates.  ZIP is a file format and file
     compression program developed and provided by Phil Katz of PKWare. 
     LZH is a public-domain file format manipulated by the program LHARC,
     among others.  ZOO is another public-domain file format for the
     compression and archival of data.
     
     NJFIND probably would not have been possible without the BRIEF
     programming editor from Underware.  If you program in any language
     under MS-DOS or OS/2, give BRIEF a look!  BRIEF is marketed by
     Solution Systems, but written by Underware.
     
     
     
     SOURCE CODE
     -----------
     
     The archive or disk which brought you NJFIND should also include the
     sourcecode and make files for the program.  If you're not a
     programmer, you probably won't be much interested in what makes
     NJFIND go.  However, if you are a coder, you may enjoy perusing the
     file NJFIND.C.
     
     NJFIND was written completely in Microsoft C Version 5.10.  You can
     use the MAKE utility supplied in the Microsoft C package to build the
     program.  NJFIND. makes the standard program and NJFINDD. makes the
     debugging version.  This debugging version spews out extra information
     about the progress that NJFIND is making, as well as some information
     about the internals that NJFIND uses to compare files and traverse
     the directory structure.
     
     I am certain that NJFIND will not compile in the QuickC interactive
     environment, but it may compile with the QCL command-line compiler.
     I know nothing of NJFIND's compatibility with Borland's Turbo C
     product, but I also know for certain that NJFIND will not compile
     as-is on the Lattice C Compiler, Version 6.01.   At least a few of
     the runtime library call names must be changed.

     
     COMPATIBILITY
     -------------
     
     NJFIND has been tested with these products:
     
|       Phil Katz/PKWare                PKZIP   Version 1.10
        Haruyasu Yoshizaki              LHARC   Version 1.13B
        Phil Katz/PKWare                PKARC   Version 3.5
        System Enhancement Associates   ARC     Version 6.00
        NoGate Consulting               PAK     Version 2.10
        Rahul Dhesi                     ZOO     Version 2.01
|	Dwight W. Campbell              DWC     Version 5.01
	Robert K Jung			ARJ	Version 2.00
        
     If you're using an older version of an archiver product, please
     contact the author of that product about getting an upgrade.  I can
     not obtain older versions, and thus can't guarantee (and frankly
     don't see a need for) backward compatibility.
     
     If you have a newer version of one of these packages and notice that
     NJFIND doesn't seem to be working correctly, please do send me a
     note.  I will be very interested in fixing NJFIND promptly to handle
     newer file compression programs.
     
     
     
     REFERENCES
     ----------
     
     I used Phil Katz's APPNOTE file, which is distributed with the
     PKZ101.EXE self-extracting Shareware version of his software.  This
     file had great descriptions of the data structures used in ZIP files.
     
     For ARC, I hacked around in the file and discovered the relatively
     simple file structure for myself.  Since NJFIND doesn't need much
     information from the file, this was relatively easy.
     
     The LHARC files were dissected by examining the sourcecode for the
     package, as found in the LHARCSRC.LZH file in a few places.  As with
     the Phil Katz program, the availability of sourcecode and
     documentation made developing the pertinent sections of NJFIND a
     snap.
     
     Information for the PAK file format came from the "Technical Notes"
     section of PAK.DOC, which I found as part of PAK210.EXE on a local
     bulletin-board system.
     
     The ZOO file format was another one that I had to hack apart myself,
     since Rahul Dhesi didn't see fit to put a description of the file
     format in his Shareware distribution package.  (This seems odd to me.
     He set things up with .MAN files and made documentation that
     resembles traditional Unix man files, but he didn't include file
     format manual pages ... most Unix systems (or at least SunOS) does
     this.  Oh, well.)  Of the five, this was the format that was a bear to
     figure out, but I eventually got it down.

|    Dwight Campbell was kind enough to send me a diskette with sourcecode
|    to a "verbose lister" for his DWC format.  This let me write the
|    supporting code for DWC archives in a very straightforward manner. 
|    The code to process DWC files is basically lifted straight from his
|    example.
