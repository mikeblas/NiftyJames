Introduction
------------

   NJRAMD is a device driver that allows you to partition a
   part of your EMS or EEMS memory as an extremely
   efficient, extremely fast "RAM disk" drive.  Having a
   part of your memory configured as a RAM disk will allow
   you to store temporary files, intermediate files, and
   other information quickly.

   NJRAMD is compatible with the Lotus/Intel/Microsoft EMS
   standard, as well as the AST/Quadram/Ashton-Tate EEMS
   standard.  NJRAMD will function equally well with both
   systems.  NJRAMD was developed under LIM EMS 3.2, and
   has been tested on LIM EMS 4.0 systems successfully.

   This program will also run with any version of DOS,
   staring with version 2.00 or later.  I wrote it under
   PC-DOS 3.1, and tested it under PC-DOS 2.00 and PC-DOS
   2.10.  The program should work with MS-DOS, but it
   hasn't been "officially" tested.

   NJRAMD takes up very little DOS space -- the program,
   depending on the configuration that you use, takes
   around 720 bytes of DOS memory, regardless of how large
   the disk space is made.  The smallest configuration of
   NJRAMD takes under 700 bytes of DOS memory.  Thus, you
   can partition a very large RAM disk, and only take up a
   very small portion of precious DOS memory.


Use and Installation
--------------------

   NJRAMD is installed as a DOS device driver when DOS is
   first loaded.  Thus, you must specify the device driver
   in the CONFIG.SYS file of your boot disk or diskette.
   The entry in the CONFIG.SYS file must be anywhere
   *after* the specification for the EMS device driver.
   For example, the EMS driver that came with my Taiwanese
   EMS clone is called INITIAL.SYS.  I also use ANSI.SYS,
   which I specify in the CONFIG.SYS file, also.  Thus, my
   CONFIG.SYS file looks like this:

                      device=\sys\initial.sys
                      device=\sys\ansi.sys
                      device=\sys\njramd.sys

|  Starting with version 1.20, this version, NJRAMD also
|  comes with a file specially prepared for computers with
|  extended instruction sets.  This includes processors
|  like the 80186, 80286, and 80386.  You can also make
|  use of this version if you have a NEC V-20 or V-30
|  installed and running in your system.

|  The version is called NJRAMDXP.SYS.  "XP" stands for
|  "Enhanced Processor".  This version of NJRAMD is coded
|  to take advantage of the special, extra instructions that
|  some CPU's have.  It is slightly smaller, and
|  considerably faster than the standard version.  If this
|  version doesn't work on your system, use the regular
|  version.

|  Even if you only have a stock PC with a NEC V-20, you
|  can expect the newver version of NJRAMD to be up to 5%
|  faster in benchmark tests.  On a real 80286 system, the
|  program will run up to 9% faster.

|  See the paragraph just before "Technical Information" if
|  you have a PC's Limited computer.

   You might also have settings for the BUFFERS, FILES,
   STACKSPACE, and BREAK settings in your CONFIG.SYS file.
   These settings can remain unchanged, as they are
   independent of NJRAMD.

   You can find more information on the uses of the
   CONFIG.SYS file in the DOS manual.  The section is
   called "Configuring your system".

   If you install NJRAMD as shown above, NJRAMD will
   default to a disk of 32 EMS Pages, which is 512
   kilobytes.  (One EMS Page is equal to 16 kilobytes of
   storage space.  16 kilobytes stores 16384 bytes, or
   characters, of information.)  If you would like to have
   a larger or smaller RAM disk, you must specify the /P
   option on the same line as NJRAMD in your CONFIG.SYS
   file.  NJRAMD allocates space in one-page increments.
   Since each EMS page is 16k bytes long, you can adjust
   the size of NJRAMD in 16k increments.

   For example, to specify a RAM disk that is 100 pages
   long, use this line in your CONFIG.SYS file:

                      device=njramd.sys /P100

   NJRAMD will try to take 100 pages of EMS memory -- this
   will give you 1600k of RAM disk space.

   Of course, you must have enough free EMS memory at the
   time that NJRAMD is loaded to accomodate the requested
   size.  If there isn't enough memory, NJRAMD will
   terminate with an error, and not install itself at all.
   If you have selected a size that is too big to fit, you
   will see the message

             Device not installed.
             Requested size too big to fit.

   Remember that if you don't tell NJRAMD otherwise, it
   will try to create a 512k RAM Disk.

|  In version 1.20 of NJRAMD, you can use the /A switch to
|  use *all* of the available EMS memory, automatically,
|  instead of specifying a /P option.  Note, though, that
|  the /A option will not leave any memory for other EMS
|  programs, such as disk cache programs or for 1-2-3.

   If there is no EMS memory available, at all, when NJRAMD
   tries to load, you will see this message:

            Device not installed.
            No free EMM Memory.

   If you see this message:

            Device not installed.
            The EMM is not installed.

   the EMM for your system was not present when NJRAMD
   loaded.  NJRAMD depends on the EMM for access to the EMS
   memory.  The specification for your EMM driver *must*
   appear before the specification for NJRAMD in your
   CONFIG.SYS file.

   Once you have entered the proper information in your
   CONFIG.SYS file, you must reboot your computer so that
   the information in the file will take effect.  When
   NJRAMD installs, it will print a copyright message, and
   some status information reguarding the memory that it
   has taken, and the amount of memory that is available as
   a RAM disk.

   If you have any problems installing NJRAMD, please feel
   free to write to me.  I'd be happy  to help!


Clicking
--------

   I programmed NJRAMD to click the system's speaker every
   time the disk was accessed.  Since a RAM disk is silent,
   it's often hard to tell when it is working.  To
   compensate for the fact that there is no "whirring" or
   "chirping" going on while the RAM disk is active, the
   speaker clicks while the program accesses the memory.

   If you find this annoying, you can turn it off by
   specifying the "/S" option in the CONFIG.SYS entry.  For
   example,
                         device=njramd.sys /P16 /S

   would create a 16-page (256k byte) RAM disk that does
   not click when it is accessed.  If you specify the /S
   option, NJRAMD will print the message

            Clicking Suppressed.

   when it is installed.

|  If you have an PC's Limited computer, with a Smart-Vu
|  display, try using the program NJRAMDPL.SYS.  This
|  version is the same as the other versions, but it
|  writes to the Smart-Vu display.  When NJRAMD is writing,
|  the display will show "NJ-W", and when it is reading, it
|  will show "NJ-R".  Other than the statements that take
|  care of the display, this version of the program is
|  identical to NJRAMDXP.SYS.

|  If you have a PC's Limited and do not want NJRAMD to
|  access the Smart-Vu display, use the NJRAMDXP.SYS
|  program.



Technical Information
--------- -----------

   I have included the assembly language source code in
   this .ARC file (or on your white distribution disk) for
   your reference.  You do not need it to run the program.
   If you are a programmer, or simply have an interest in
   "what makes it go", you can take a look at the
   NJRAMD.ASM file.  I've heavily commented it, and
   therefore will not describe it in greater detail here.


Shareware
---------

   This program is a work of Shareware.  If you use the
   program, I expect you to end a registration fee of $15.

   Registering your copy of NJRAMD will automatically
   entitle you to free updates.   I'd like to receive a
   dollar with each update request; this will let me just
   about break even, with the cost of diskettes, postage,
   and mailers.

   If you would like to write to me, my address is

         Mike Blaszczak

   Please feel free to send your comments, questions,
   suggestions, donations, marriage proposals, and
   get-rich-quick schemes.

   I'm really interested in hearing any ideas that you
   have about NJRAMD, as well as any questions you have
   about it.  If you run into any problems, please feel
   free to call or write.  (I don't give my phone number,
   but, if you're serious enough, call directory
   assistance.)

A Special Note
--------------

   This program would not have been possible without the
   outstanding generosity and good will of Doctor File
   Finder and Bob Brody.

   Hats off to a couple of wonderful people!

   Doctor File Finder managed to find a bug in the first
   version that sometimes caused the program to trash the
   files on the disk -- the GetSector procedure wasn't
   working properly.  The problem has been corrected in
   this version, and the program's optimization in the
   GetSector proceudre is now fully functional.

   Again, the Good Doctor helped me track down the bug that
   sometimes caused this device driver to ignore the /Page
   option.  Thanks, Doc!  The fix was made, and this is
   now Version 1.15.

|  Version 1.20 just let me flex my 80286 knowledge by
|  adding the additional instructions.  The program also is
|  the first version to be developed under Microsoft Macro
|  Assembler Version 5.00.

|  Version 1.30 was released to refelect my newfound status
|  in the Association of Shareware Profesionals.
