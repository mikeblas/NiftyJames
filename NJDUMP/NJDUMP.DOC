Nifty James' Famous Object File Dumper

Version 0.50




This program is designed to list the format and output of .OBJ and
.LIB files.  The program takes the file as its input, and prints its
descriptive output to the standard output device.

The program follows the .OBJ standards set forth by Intel in the
document "8086 Relocatable Object Module Formats".  The .OBJ and .LIB
file formats are described in great detail in this text.  It can be
ordered for about $15 from

     Intel Literature Sales
     PO Box 58130
     Santa Clara, CA  95052-8130

The book's order number is 121748-001.

One type of record that is found in .OBJ files is defined by
Microsoft.  This is record type 0xB0.  The record seems to have
something to do with the data used by the Codeview debugger, but it's
hard to tell for sure.  I've written Microsoft about this, and, to
date, I've received no response from them.

I originally intended this program to be a very complete OBJ file
lister.  However, it seems that this is really a pretty considerable
task.  The program, in its current state, will read and print some of
the information in .LIB files, but the .LIB file format that MS-DOS
machines use is not compatible with what's in the Intel
specification.  I've had a hard time finding information on the
Microsoft .LIB format, so I guess it'll go unsupported.

These are the record types that are currently supported

        LHEADR     THEADR     REDATA     LEDATA     LNAMES
        PUBDEF     COMENT     FIXUPP     EXTDEF     MODEND
        GRPDEF     SEGDEF     ENDREC     LINNUM

If there are any registrations (at all) for the program, I'll
continue to develop it and debug it.  I'm interested in hearing about
any bugs!

This program is a work of shareware.  If you find it useful, please
send a $10 to register your copy.  If you'd like to send more or less,
please feel free to do so.  If you do not find this program useful, I
hope that you at least learn something from the sourcecode.

REDISTRIBUTING THIS PROGRAM FOR PROFIT IS NOT PERMITTED WITHOUT THE
PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE PROGRAM AUTHOR.  REDISTRIBUTING THIS
SOFTWARE WITHOUT THE AUTHORS KNOWLEDGE IS A CRIME.

If have not described the .OBJ or .LIB formats in this text.  The
best source for information on that is the Intel manual, mentioned
above.  If you have any questions about the files, I'll be happy to
answer them if you send them in a letter with return postage.

Thank you!
