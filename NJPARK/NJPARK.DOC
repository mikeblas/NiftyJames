CONSENT OF THE AUTHOR.  RESELLING THIS PROGRAM FOR PROFIT OR OFFERING
THIS PROGRAM AS INSENTIVE TO PURCHASE IS UNLAWFUL.



This simple utility quickly parks the read-write heads of all hard
disk drives attached to the system.  The program has been tested on
Seagate ST-238, ST-238R, and ST-251 drives.  The program should work
with all Seagate hard disk drives, and will probably work with any
hard disk drive that has a landing area after the last data cylinder.

To run NJPARK, simply type

	NJPARK

at the DOS command prompt.  The NJPARK.EXE file will be loaded and
run.  The program will report an error if the BIOS thinks that no
disk drives are installed.  For this reason, the program may not work
on older systems with special nonstandard hardware.

NJPARK will then find the last data sector for each disk drive, and
try to seek eight cylinders past that data sector.  This is the
method specified by Seagate:

	"The read/write heads may be parked in the shipping zone by
	 issuing a seek to any cylinder between 615-670.  The drive
	 may then be powered down."

(This is from the Seagate ST-238 Product Manual, section 1.8.3.)

Since this seek-to-landing cylinder range is just past the last
normal data cylinder, NJPARK will seek to it by adding eight
cylinders to the last cylinder number.

NJPARK prints a message for each hard disk drive parked.  The message
should reflect a number that is within your hard disk drive's parking
zone.  For most drives, you can tell that the heads are parked by a
louder click when the heads are latched, or a very long seek time as
the drive pulls the head assembly out of the way.

If you have any doubt that NJPARK will not work for your hard disk
drive, you should consult the disk drive manufactuer.

I can assume no responsibility, direct or indirect, for the use of
NJPARK.  I use it on my own drives, and that should be enough proof
that I have confidence in my own work.  If another parking program
was supplied with your drives, you should use that program if
possible.

If you find this program useful, please send a registration fee of
$5.  To mail your check, or to adress me with any comments,
