This document isn't formatted at all.  It is, tho, eighty columns wide.

Dedicated to the folks in "IBM ASSEMBLY"; Steve Gibson, Cynic Al, Mike
Quinlan.  To Barbarian for getting me to C-things the right way, and to
Mike Todd for being so supportive.  And so funny.  Special thanks to
Avatar for catching some dormant, DOS 2.0 related bugs.

The rain tapped on the roof and rivited the aluminum siding around the
computer room.  The phosphors on the screen jumped to life, lighting the
young man's face.  He tapped a few more keys, and the nearby printer
screeched to life, temporarily scaring away the rain and drowning out the
late night talk show host.  The programmer rose, rolling his chair back
along the hexagons of the static-mat.  He fed the printer more paper, and
ripped the result of his efforts from the printer.  He sighed, wrinkled
his eyebrows, and crumpled the paper.  He sat down, staring at the screen,
his tapping foot disrupting the rest of an empty Doritos' bag.  He tapped
a few more keys, sending the cursor flying about the screen.  He paused,
scratching his slowly apperaing stubble, tapped another key and the
printer screeched to life once again.  As he rose, the clock atop his
monitor beeped the arrival of three AM.  He tore the paper from the
machine, and it was good.

Nifty James' Famous Letter Quality Printer was born.


NJLQP is a program that allows a computist with an EPSON graphics printer
to print near-letter quality type.  The program works in a method much similar
to the TYPE command of DOS, with a few enhancements.  It is designed for
people who, for one reason or another, can't or won't buy a letter quality
printer to replace their trusty old dot matrix.  NJLQP takes text from a
standard ASCII file and prints it to your graphics-capable dot matrix
printer.  It uses an attractive Roman Serif font, and runs at a reasonable
speed.

Once you unpack NJLQP from its archive, you can enter NJLQP from the DOS
prompt.  You will be rewarded with the following "help" display:


Usage:
  [path\]NJLQP [drive:][\path\]filename [[drive:][\path\]filename] [options]

        options --      -f  print formfeed after file
                        -p  print over perforation
                        -e  echo the file to stdout


Ooof!  Well, all that means is this:


1) If  you're using NJLQP under DOS 3.00 or greater, you can enter a
   pathname before the command.  If you're in a directory called SOMEPLACE,
   and NJLQP is in a directory called FARAWAY, you can run NJLQP by typing
   it's path before it's name:  \FARAWAY\NJLQP.   If you don't really get
   this, or didn't know about this feature, grab the DOS 3.10 manual, and
   take a look at page 5-15.  If you're using a DOS version earlier than
   3.0, you won't be able to type a path before the command name.


2) NJLQP.  Well, that's the command name.  If you so choose, you can
   rename the program to another, more convenient name.  All I ask is
   that you remember to change the name back if you distribute it to
   a friend or a BBS system.  Thanks!


3) [drive:][\path\]filename.  This tells NJLQP what file you would like to
   print.  Of course, only the file name *has* to be there.  If you want,
   you can preceed it with a path, a drive name, or both.  NJLQP will open
   this file, read it, and print it.  The command COPY FRED.TXT LPT1: and
   NJLQP FRED.TXT both print the file FRED.TXT.  One, of course, just does a
   better job of it.  You must specify a file extension, if there is one,
   becuase NJLQP will not assume that there is one.


4) [[drive:][\path\]filename].  This is an optional field.  If it's there,
   it will be the output file or device.  If you enter NJLQP FRED.TXT COM1:,
   then FRED.TXT will be printed, and the output will go to COM1.  If you
   enter NJLQP FRED.TXT FRED.LQP, then FRED.TXT will be printed to FRED.LQP.
   This is an interesting feature because you can use it to print in letter
   quality to a printer spooler.  Later, you could type PRINT FRED.LQP, and
   the letter quality version of FRED.TXT will be printed by the printer
   spooler.  Be careful, though, because the letter quality version of a
   file takes up about 24 times (!) as much space as the regular file.  This
   should give you a good idea of how much graphics data is output to the
   printer.

   Now, watchout.  If you execute, say NJLQP THIS.TXT THIS.LQP in the
   morning, and you decide to print it just before your coffee break, while
   you won't be using the computer, anyway, you must use the /B option of
   the COPY command.  When you enter COPY THIS.LQP LPT1: just as you get
   your coffee, DOS will decide that THIS.LQP is shorter than it really is.
   If, instead, you specify COPY THIS.LQP LPT1: /B, then DOS will correctly
   calculate the length of THIS.LQP, and you'll be all set, no problems.


5) [options].  These are the options; you should specify them last, if you
   wish to specify them at all.  The options are listed after the command
   line above, and I'll describe them below.  Anyway, you can preceed them
   with a minus (-), or a slash (/); it doesn't matter, NJLQP will recognize
   both.  The letter discribing the option can be upper or lower case, that
   doesn't matter either; NJLQP will understand either.


6) -f.  If you specify this option, NJLQP will automatically print a
   formfeed after the file that was to be printed.  This is useful if you
   are running NJLQP from a batch file, and you won't be around do tap the
   "FF"  key on your printer.  If you don't specify this option, you'll have
   to feed the paper yourself; printing will stop wherever it does.


7) -p.  Most people use fan-feed paper.  Between each page, there is a
   preforation.   If you specify the -P option, NJLQP will print over the
   preforation, yielding sixty-six lines per page.  If you don't specify the
   -P option, NJLQP will skip six lines around the perforation, and you will
   only have sixty lines per page.


8) -e.  If this option is not printed, NJLQP will only print is banner and
   other progress information to the screen.  If you do specify this option,
   the file will be printed to the standard output device (most often the
   screen), as it is printed to the printer or the specified output file.


That's really all you need to know about NJLQP to use it.  I'll talk about
how I wrote the program and the traditional ShareWare plug, some perfomance
information, and a techincal description of what's going on inside there.
The sourcecode (NJLQP.ASM and EPSCHR1.INC) is included for your reference.


Disadvantages
-------------

Well.  Since I'm an honest guy, I'll tell you about the problems with
NJLQP.  It's my program, and I use it all the time, since I cant afford a
better dot-matrix, or a good daisy-wheel printer.

Firstoff, since NJLQP reads the keyboard constantly, you can't type ahead
while the program is running.  NJLQP keeps reading the keyboard to see if
you pressed ESC.  If it gets any other character, it disreguards it.  So,
while NJLQP is doing its thing, you can't make use of the keyboard buffer.
Sorry... I love to type ahead, and this error hurts me, too.  In the next
version, it will be corrected.

The other problem is that NJLQP won't accept wildcard filenames.  That is,
you can't say

    NJLQP *.TXT -f

to print all the files with the extention .TXT.  This will be fixed in the
next version, too.  But, for now, you can make use of a little-known DOS
trick to type more than one file.  At the DOS prompt, type this:

   FOR %1 in (*.TXT) do NJLQP %1 -f

That will search the disk for every file with the .TXT extension.  Note
that the files that you want to specify are in parenthesis there.  After
the word "do", you should type the command for NJLQP as you would normally
use it.  You can include any options that you want.  To print the files
THIS, THAT and OTHER, you'd use this:

   FOR %1 in (THIS THAT OTHER) do NJLQP %1 -f

If you want more information on this feature of DOS, it's on page 6-37 of
the DOS 2.00 manual; on page 2-22 of the DOS 2.10 manual; and on page 7-32
of the DOS 3.10 manual.  (Note though, that the examples in the DOS books
show the command with two percent signs... you only need one, in this
application.)


Shareware and Me
--------- --- --

Okay.  You downloaded this program from a BBS or the IBMSIG or somesuch
place.  And you use it.  Quite a bit... at least once or twice a week, to
print letters, files, all kinds of stuff.  You really appreciate the idea.
So, then, send me some money!

I put a good deal of time into this program; I think it is quite
significant.  It can be the difference between you throwing out a big wad
on a letter quality printer, or a denser dot-matrix printer.  You got it
for free, for the cost of a phone call or online time or whatever.  I
spent some time writing it, though.  I'm sort of a starving artist.  I'm a
teenager, just a high-school student.  And shelling out $150 for a macro
assembler or five hundred bucks for a C compiler is an arm and a leg.
Especially after paying for a computer system in the first place.  If
you could send $5 or $10 or even $20, I'd really appreciate it.

Thank you, very much.

Now, even if you can't, or don't want to send some dough, I can understand.
If you've comments, compliments, criticisims, or questions, get them to me,
and I'll try to get you an answer.  Include a method of reaching yourself;
your Source number, or your mailing address.  I'll try to get back to you.


Support
-------

Now, if you've another kind of printer, and you've seen a sample of this
program, and you're dying to have it run on your system, then drop me a
line.  If you can get the information I need to me somehow, I can most
likely re-write or create a new version for your printer.  I've tried
writing to printer companies for information, but they have been pretty
quiet, so far.

If you find a bug or a problem or a glitch or something, please let me know.
I can't diagnose everything, especially from a distance through a asynch
port, but I'll try.

And, of course, if you'd like to write me just for the hell of it, feel free
to.  I like to have pen-pals.

(TB) - Too big... the resulting file was simply too big for the named device
       to handle.  (ie, my RAM drive simply can't hold all the data that
       NJLQP generated.)

(*)  - This just shows how fast the a paralell Epson FX80 normally prints;
       all the other tests show how fast NJLQP prints.


Benchmark Mania
--------- -----

These charts are just to compare NJLQP to other methods of printing, and to
let you compare NJLQP to your favoirte daisy-wheel or other letter quality
printer.

I took the times from the when <ENTER> was pressed on the command line to
when the DOS prompt was displayed.  The file to be printed was stored on a
RAM Drive, so there is no error or deviation from having a certain floppy or
hard drive or some such.  Of course, the RAM Drive in question is VDISK 2.0
from the DOS 3.1 package.  I did the timing with a digital stopwatch.

Each timing is the result of an average of three runs.  The CPS value is
simply the number of bytes in the file divided by the number of seconds to
print the file.



Batch Files
----- -----

You might want to print a whole bunch of files at once.  The most logical
way to do this would be to either run NJLQP with a print spooler, or to run
it in a .BAT file while you sleep, get some coffee, or call Mom.  To aid in
batch file printing, NJLQP allows the user to read ERRORLEVEL to see what
happened.   These values are returned from NJLQP:

    ERRORLEVEL        Problem
    ----------        -------
        0             None; file printed successfully.
        1             Usage error, ie, too many filenames or
                        bad options or some other unrecognizable
                        stuff on the command line.
        2             Too Full.  The output device was full, the
                        output file was erased.
        3             File open error.  Either the input file
                        wasn't found, or the output device was
                        full.
        4             User aborted by tapping ESC.




About Money
----- -----

I need it.  BAD.  If you'd care to send a contribution, I really wouldn't
mind much.  Thank you!

I welcome any feedback and suggestions that you'd care to offer.

If you have a printer that this program doesn't work for, please let me
know.  If you send in a contribution and a letter telling me the program
doesn't work and the printer it won't work on, I'll get back to you and
see if we can work it out.

This version is written for the EPSON, and says so in the banner (type
NJLQP with no parameters).  If another version is made available, it will
mention the name of that printer in
the banner.
