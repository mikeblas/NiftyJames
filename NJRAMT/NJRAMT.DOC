Nifty James' Famous EMS RAM Tester

Version 1.00 of 21 October 1987


   This program is designed to test the EMS or EEMS memory upon
   the startup of your computer system.  The program is styled
   as a device driver, so that it can get at the EMS memory
   before any other device drivers (such as NJRAMD).

   The program is installed by inserting the line

        DEVICE=NJRAMT.SYS

   *immediately* after the CONFIG command that installs the EMS
   driver.

   This program *must* execute before any other EMS programs, as
   it requires access to *all* of the EMS memory.  It takes no
   DOS memory, or EMS memory, after it has run, however.

   The program works by filling each EMS page with four
   different patterns.  The program checks to see if each of the
   patterns are stored correctly.

   A progress display is maintained on the screen while the
   program is running.  It shows

       Page       1 tested

   for each page tested.  If the program encounters an error
   during testing, the program will display

       Error on page     1!

   to indicate that an error occurred.

   The EMM memory manager program tests the memory to a very
   limited extent.  NJRAMT is designed for people who would like
   the piece of mind that an additional, more extensive test,
   provides.

   The program tests the memory rather quickly.  However, if you
   find that you're impatient, and would like to abort the test,
   simply strike any key.  The program will abort, and "fall
   through" to the next command in your CONFIG.SYS file.

   This is a work of shareware.  RESELLING THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT
   THE PRIOR WRITTEN CONSENT OF THE AUTHOR IS PROHIBITED.
   SELLING THIS PROGRAM WITHOUT THE AUTHORS KNOWLEDGE IS A
   CRIME.

   I'd like to receive a registration of $5.  However, if you
   find the program of more or less value, please feel free to
   send more or less of a registration fee.

   The file NJRAMTXP.SYS is a special version of the program for
   users with V-20, V-30, 80286 or 80386 CPUs in their
   computers.  This version works *slightly* faster.

   If you have any questions about the program, or would just
   like to talk, please feel free to send me a letter.  I love
   to hear from anyone.
